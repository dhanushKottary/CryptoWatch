This website is designed to provide up-to-date information on the top 50 cryptocurrencies from around the world. It also serves as a template for individuals who want to become crypto enthusiasts and provide services related to cryptocurrency. I came across this website in one of the portfolio reviews on youtube and was completely impressed by the design. So I decided to refer to that as an template and code this website. Yes, the website is completely responsive!
